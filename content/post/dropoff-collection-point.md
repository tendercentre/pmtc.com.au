The Port Macquarie Tender Centre is now offering a free drop-off/collection service
throughout the month of September.

We will take in, store and handle payment of goods sold privately as a service
to the community.

We are hoping the local community will find this a safer way to sell goods
privately, as well as the added convenience of not having to organise times that
both the buyer and seller are available, just drop off your goods, or collect
the items you are buying any time during our business hours.

We'd love your feedback as this is a new service, and we will be charging a small
handling fee in the future if the service proves to be successful in order to
make this sustainable.
