At the Port Macquarie Tender Centre, we understand the logistical and emotional challenges involved in downsizing a home or clearing a deceased estate.

We aim to offer a customised service that can be adapted entirely to your needs, circumstances and priorities. We will value and sell your items with minimal effort on your part, giving you one less thing to worry about during an already stressful time.
