<!-- If you find something you're interested in, please check the lot number with one of our friendly staff members. If you're happy to pay reserve price for it, plus the buyer's premium (11% plus a $3.30 processing fee) you can take it on the spot (provided it has not already sold and is pending collection). If you want to offer less than reserve price on something, you will need to place a bid. Bidding is easy; just fill out a simple form with the item(s) you wish to bid on, a bid price, and your contact information either instore or in the online form below. We have what is called a 'silent auction' so you will not know what other bids have been placed until the tender closes, which happens at 2:00pm every Sunday. To get your results, check your email Sunday night (if you bid below reserve price, keep in mind that we have yet to speak to the vendors at this point, so items listed as 'passed in' may still be accepted early in the week). You can also check your results over the phone by calling us on (02) 6581 3122\. -->
